    <b> Course Introduction </b><br>
This graduate level research class focuses on deep learning techniques for vision, speech and 
    natural language processing problems. 
    It gives an overview of the various deep learning models and techniques, and surveys recent advances in the related fields.
<br>
This course uses Tensorflow as the primary programminging tool. 
However, other toolkits including pyTorch, or MxNet are also OK. 
We will use Google cloud as the main programming platform. Students are encouraged to install their computer with GPU cards.
<br>
Four homeworks and one final project with a heavy programming workload are expected.
<br>
    
    <b> Grading </b>
<ul>
<li> 40% homework
<li> 20% paper presentation and course attendence
<li> 40% final project
</ul>    

    
<b> Recommended Books </b><br>
There is no required book for this class. But the following reading materials are recommended to read beyond the class:
<ul>    
    <li> Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville: <a href="http://www.deeplearningbook.org/">Deep Learning</a>
